# vtar

A tar implementation written in pure V.

This is pre-alpha software! Please do not use this in production environments
unless you are willing to report issues.

## Building

- Clone the repository
- Run `v .`

## Roadmap

Currently, my plan is to implement archive reading/writing for the headers
one at a time to ensure they are usable on each addition
